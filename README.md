# Banking System in C++

This C++ project simulates basic banking operations using object-oriented programming principles. It provides functionalities to manage bank accounts, perform transactions, and persist data using file handling.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create savings or checking accounts with initial balances.
- **Transaction Handling**: Deposit funds, withdraw money, and transfer money between accounts.
- **Data Persistence**: Accounts are stored and retrieved from a text file (`accounts.txt`).
- **Error Handling**: Manage errors such as insufficient balance or non-existent accounts gracefully.
- **User Interface**: Interactive console-based interface for user interaction.

## Classes and Components

### Account Class Hierarchy

- **Account**: Base class for generic bank account operations.
- **SavingsAccount**: Derived class with specific rules for savings accounts.
- **CheckingAccount**: Derived class with specific rules for checking accounts.

### Bank Class

- Manages accounts using a `map<int, Account*>`.
- Provides methods to add, delete, retrieve, and display accounts.
- Handles transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.

### Transaction Classes

- **Transaction**: Abstract base class defining common transaction methods.
- **DepositTransaction**: Implements deposit operation.
- **WithdrawTransaction**: Implements withdrawal operation.
- **Transfer**: Implements fund transfer between accounts.

### File Handling

- Accounts are serialized (`save_to_file()`) and deserialized (`load_from_file()`) to maintain data persistence across sessions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-system.git
   cd banking-system
   ```

2. **Compile and Run**:
   - Compile the `main.cpp` file using your C++ compiler:
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o banking_system
     ```
   - Run the executable:
     ```bash
     ./banking_system
     ```

3. **Interact with the Banking System**:
   - Follow the console prompts to create accounts, perform transactions, and manage accounts.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Ensure `accounts.txt` is present in the same directory for saving and loading account data.

### Explanation of Markdown Syntax Used:

- **Headings**: Created using `#` for main headings (`#`) and subheadings (`##`, `###`).
- **Lists**: Unordered lists (`-`) are used for listing features and components.
- **Code Blocks**: Enclosed in triple backticks (` ``` `) for commands and code snippets.
- **Links**: Enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) followed by the URL in parentheses (`()`).
- **Emphasis**: **Bold** text is created by enclosing it in double asterisks (`**`).

### Usage Notes:
- Replace `your-username` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username or organization name.
- Ensure that the file paths (`accounts.txt`, `LICENSE`) are correctly specified according to your project structure.
